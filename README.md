In the era of digital transformation, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a key technology driving innovation across various industries, including retail. Traditional shopping methods often rely on human intuition and manual product selection, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. To address these challenges, GroMind is developed as an AI-powered intelligent shopping assistant that enhances the shopping experience through smart recommendations and data-driven decision-making.

GroMind analyzes users’ shopping behaviors, product attributes, and historical data to provide personalized product suggestions. By leveraging machine learning and recommendation algorithms, the system aims to improve efficiency, reduce decision fatigue, and optimize purchasing choices. The project also serves as a practical demonstration of applying AI and recommendation systems in modern retail environments, contributing to the development of smart market ecosystems.
